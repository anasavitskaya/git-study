People don't know much
Need a whiskey crush
To think of something new
Hey you watching me
Lookin' through a screen
I'm here in front of you
Sometimes the days, they feel so long
Yeah, we all live under the same sun
So I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again, and again
'Cause I don't wanna be like them
I hit my head up against the wall
Over and over and over and over again
And again and again
People piss you off
Some you say you love
Those you call a friend
Walking through a crowd
Then you look around
See there's no one left
We live and then we die as one
Yeah, we all live under the same sun
